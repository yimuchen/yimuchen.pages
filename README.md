# GitHub Pages blog using svelte

New location for my GitHub pages blog, now powered by [Svelte][svelte]. This is
in light of better structure of JavaScript/frontend projects after my
experience with the GUI program (though that used React). I also wanted to
clean up some of the more embarrasing entries that I had on my old blog entry,
as well as place this as an equal footing to other project pages.

This also requires that the `deploy` be explicitly called for deployment rather
than using GitHub actions for now. So remember to run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```
