Beamer</a> for making
presentation slides. Latex is a very… unpleasant markup language to work with
when typing the small section of text used in slides, the over-head is just too
high, and default settings for various slide elements is either non-existent or
hard to find proper documentations. I thought it was maybe time to try and
find an alternative to use.`,E,m,oe='<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#what-i-was-looking-for"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>What I was looking for',B,b,se=`There are still quite a lot of aspects of Latex beamer that I wish I could keep
in the new platform that I am looking for.`,U,x,re=`<li><p><strong>Cut between template design in content design:</strong> This is the part I find
very annoying with most GUI based document makers, for most of the slides,
I would like to keep a uniformed look, and for some reason I had always
thought the way GUI based presentation makers handled templates is a bit
hard to work with and difficult to pass between machines.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Minimal Overhead in document:</strong> The main problem with making slides in
latex is that often the documents is cluttered up with the latex commands
rather than the content.
<a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/" rel="nofollow">Markdown</a> is one
of the most lightweight yet comprehensive markup languages, and what it
lacks in advanced formatting features, it makes up for by allowing embed
HTML! Here apparently HTML/CSS web based tools would be a good idea to
proceed. I have always shied away at the idea since I didn’t like the
aesthetics of HTML tags in documents too much. But is everything could be
packed into CSS, this might be a good alternative to work with!</p></li> <li><p><strong>Minimal use of external tools:</strong> I would rather that I don’t have to
constantly switch between application to make a document. Right now,
everything other document related tasks are performed using
<a href="https://atom.io/" rel="nofollow">atom</a> as my primary editor, so I would prefer
text-based applications, but I would mind a whole new platform if it meant
there is a good all-in-one package where I can complete all of my editing
works.</p></li> <li><p><strong>(Optional) WYSIWYG editing:</strong> Many things in slide creation are
case-by-case: adding description beside a diagram, tweaking template
parameters. I must say that text based is precise, but very slow to make
graphical changes.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Local editing:</strong> I’m not a bit fan of cloud editing.</p></li>`,z,f,he='<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#what-i-found"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>What I found',R,I,de=`When searching for a solution that uses

simple work flow if I’m going for a simple slide look, by at the same time,
I won’t be limited by Markdown if I want to make something fancier. It also
means I could embed it into other websites if I so desire.</p></li> <li><p>Text based. Talk about no other tools.</p></li> <li><p>WYSIWYG Editing. This is where is fall flat. There is the <a href="https://slides.com/" rel="nofollow">official

will be JavaScript libraries to export with atom, but that is getting ahead of
