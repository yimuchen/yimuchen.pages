to get used to coming from Taiwan was the scale of distance scale everything.
Be it commuting to school, grabbing groceries, even the size of the rooms in
the apartment for getting stuff in your own living space. While a large room is
generally a good thing, one important utility is heavily impacted by this
merit: networking.`,T,u,D='<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-problem"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The problem',H,f,G=`The typical Wi-Fi router given by the service provider does a well enough job
of covering the apartment space. But for rooms further away from the router,
networking qualities suffers immensely from random packet drops, both downing
the networking speed to less than one-twentieth of what was being paid for,
makes video playbacks prone to random buffering, and incredibly stressful
moments when the internet decides to drop midway through filling an online
form.`,M,g,E=`While my flatmate had previously bought a Wi-Fi extender, the thing was a cheap
model, prone to overheating after prolong uses. While it recovered the speed to
one-tenth of the supposed speed, drops still occur on a regular basis, changing
the infrequent network drop-out to a stable 30-minute drop-out cycle. Since I
massively rely on networking for both work and entertainment, looking for a
more permanent solution was quite the priority.`,I,d,N='<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#searching-for-a-solution"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Searching for a solution',L,v,V=`Getting a “better” Wi-Fi extender is an obvious solution, but not one I am very
fond of. Despite the many outlets that we have in our rooms, there wasn’t one
in the long hallway that is the main reason for a long transmission distance,
so adding a Wi-Fi extended would mean running a long power-extender along the
hallway (the inelegant solution that was previously being used with the cheap
Wi-Fi extender). Also, I am still of the opinion that a good signal requires a
physical wire, regardless of how far wireless technology has developed, but at
the same time. I also don’t want to be fixing some 20+ meters of CAT6 cable
around the apartment, as I wasn’t confident with my understanding of my lease
statements on wall/floor fixations, and neither was I confident with my
handy work at keeping such a long cable neat and functional.`,P,c,J='<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-chosen-solution"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The chosen solution',S,w,K=`The solution that I finally decided on taking up relied on the abundance of
good wiring that already existed in the apartment: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-line_communication" rel="nofollow">Powerline
networking</a> kits, essentially using the power lines in your living
space as a massive Ethernet signal transmission media, with the adapter
machines placed on outlets. For me, choosing the model to buy was rather more
demanding than I had thought:`,W,y,O=`<li><p>Must have wired connection to outside device: It would be nice to have wired
connections for more network critical tasks such as access to remote machines
(<del>and online-gaming</del>).</p></li> <li><p>Must have wirless connections to outside devices: I have a phone, and also
would be handing if I immediately need the network for someone in my room.</p></li> <li><p>Must have outlet by-pass. I would rather not have to give up a power outlet
just for a relatively low-power device.</p></li>`,q,b,Q=`The first two actually limits my choices to rather high-end devices that cost
around 130USD on Amazon, but you can look for starter kits for around 35-50USD,
depending on the manufacturer if you are willing to give up a few functions. I
don’t regret getting an overkill solution, as such supporting speeds also
future-proofs any potential services upgrades in the future.`,F,p,R='<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#setting-the-solution-and-the-results"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Setting the solution and the results',j,x,X=`Basic set up the device was easy, simple connect the adapter and extender end of
the kit into neighboring outlets, and connect the adapter to the router, and
we are all set to go! Moved the extender to my bedroom, and yep! Getting nearly
the max outgoing networking speed all the way in my room at the end of the hall,
a near 30-50 times improvement!`,A,k,Y=`There is still things that I haven’t taken care of yet: The connection in the
wall is still not password protected, so I cannot (yet) protect against
neighbors that manage to find out that we are potentially paying for their
