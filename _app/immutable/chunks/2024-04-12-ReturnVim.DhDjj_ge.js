<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(text_editor)" rel="nofollow">Atom</a> (and later <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="nofollow">VS Code</a>); four months ago, I started
reconfiguring the many dot files to once again make the
(<a href="https://neovim.io/" rel="nofollow">neo</a>)<a href="https://www.vim.org/" rel="nofollow">vim</a> my main editor. After close to cleaning up my first
round of ricing (yes, it took 4 months), I’ve decided to revisit some of the
issues I had when with vim at the time, and see what has changed my influence
to change yet again.`,V,u,Te='<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-cases-i-made-for-an-alternate-editor"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The cases I made for an alternate editor',B,y,He=`My old writing contained quite a bit of unrelated rambling, so to condense it
down the following points:`,O,k,Ie=`<li><p><strong>Graphical feedback</strong>: from the smaller things like icons for indications of
file type when navigating file systems; odd items like a minimap for
indicating the overall file layout; preview to graphical output elements,
like plots and latex formulas.</p> <p>While some of these items are partially solved with newer technologies (such
as the first item with <a href="https://www.nerdfonts.com/" rel="nofollow">nerd fonts</a>; <a href="https://saitoha.github.io/libsixel/" rel="nofollow">sixel</a> for graphical
results display), the requirement for constant feed-back actually points to a
different issue in editing that I did not properly identify: can my editor
help me make less mistakes, and indicate when I might be doing something
wrong? The tools that has been developed since then also means that new
editing tools make a lot of the concerns that I have be a moot point.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Obtuse-ness</strong>: At the time, I was complaining that keystrokes in vim was
“too different” from other programs. What I realized over time is that
problem with keystrokes is less to do with how obtuse the keystrokes are, but
rather how easy it is to look up keystrokes that you might have forgotten,
either because you are still learning the system, or it is a functionality
that you did not use for some time. An alternate workflow for graphical
editors for example:, while the keystrokes required to insert a “π” character
in LibreOffice is also rather obtuse (<code>&lt;Alt&gt;i&lt;Alt&gt;ppi&lt;Cr&gt;&lt;Esc&gt;</code>), because of
the graphical feedback, on holding down <code>Alt</code>, you can immediately see what
keystrokes are needed to navigate the toolbar to reach what you need. So
effectively, when trying to learn a new function, the only keystroke that I
need to keep track of is effectively just <code>Alt</code>. At the time, I did not know
whether there is an easy way to discover the mapping of additional vim
motions other than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM" rel="nofollow">RTFM</a>. While reading the manual should be the best
path to learn, having to constantly hop in-and-out of the editor just to
learn the editor add rather heavily to the already steep learning curve.</p> <p>Another aspect of obtuseness that I did not explicitly say, was also that
configuring vim via <a href="https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/" rel="nofollow">vimscript</a> did (at least at the time), feel a
lot less intuitive than writing a JSON file that feels easier to organize and
track for configuration. This is one of the reasons that I opted to use
<a href="https://neovim.io/" rel="nofollow">neovim</a> rather than <a href="https://www.vim.org/" rel="nofollow">vim</a>, with understanding how to do
configurations with a general purpose language (<a href="https://www.lua.org/" rel="nofollow">lua</a>) makes everything
simpler to learn.</p></li>`,N,b,Me=`How that I have re-discussed the pain points that pushed me away from vim eight

general workflow: how can my editor assist in text editing, pointing out when I

back into wanting to use neovim.`,J,m,ze='<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#language-server-protocol"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Language server protocol',K,L,je=`<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/" rel="nofollow">Language server protocols (LSP)</a> is what is need for you editor to

ability to make give in-time syntax error warning, context aware autocomplete,
function signature lookup and hinting, and project-wide navigation and editing.
Here we have a look at some of the functionality that can be brought to the
editor if your editor has full integration with the language that you are
working with. Because LSPs are a program separate from the actual editor, this
means that it will not slow down you keystrokes on large files/project (one on
the reasons why I gave up on an autocomplete plugin when I was using vanilla vim
8 years ago), just that the suggestions might take a bit longer to show up.`,Q,T,qe="<li>Syntax error indicator and warnings</li> <li>Context-aware autocomplete</li> <li>Function signature look up</li> <li>Code navigation - go to definition</li> <li>Code navigation - go to call instances</li> <li>Code navigation - go to next issue/list all issues in directory</li> <li>Project wide renaming</li>",X,H,Pe=`<img src="../../image/posts/20240412/lsp_opt.GIF"/> <figcaption>A quick demonstraction of the functionalities of LSP in code editing

find it cohesive, and there are already complete resources out there for

What if I only remember some part of what I wanted to look up? Fuzzy finding is
by no means a “new” idea, but the maturity of a fuzzy finding plugin such as
<a href="https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim" rel="nofollow">telescope</a>, and its integration with neovim itself and its plugin
functionalities means that there is now just a few sets of keystrokes that you
need to set up to generically find items when code editing. You have actually
seen telescope in action in the demonstation of the LSP functionalities. But
here are some additional niceties that was not demonstrated:`,te,C,Ue="<li>Find file by name (regardless of nested directory)</li> <li>Find file by grep pattern</li> <li>Find neovim lua API</li> <li>Find in current key maps</li>",ie,_,Ee='<img src="../../image/posts/20240412/fzf_opt.GIF"/> <figcaption>Some common search navigations one can achieve with a good fuzzy finder.</figcaption>',oe,z,Re=`The maturity of such plugins arguably changed my workflow just as much as LSPs,
as jumping between what needs to be edited was something that disrupted my
though process quite a bit. While fuzzy searches exist for the graphical
editors, each item typically needs to open up something additional start the
lookup process. Here the simplicity of a text-based interact actually works in
favor of such functionalities, with any search being able to fired up
immediately with a similar interface. Using this, my old requirements of
keeping a file tree open at all times, having a file layout minimap, and having
to have a separate “project manager” functionality in the editor now looks like
and strange solution to a problematic workflow.`,ne,ae,le,j,We=`Of course, being an open source project, there are of course many ways to add
