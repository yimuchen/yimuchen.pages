myself or a small group of people on the same physics analysis team. While I
make an effort to ensure the routine are readable/maintainable to people other
than myself, this type of work typically is not indicative to how well I
actually achieved readability/maintainability goals. Though recently, I’ve
started to contribute to some of the newer numerical libraries that I have been
using, trying to add tools for general use: here are <a href="https://github.com/CoffeaTeam/coffea/pull/798" rel="nofollow">some</a> <a href="https://github.com/CoffeaTeam/coffea/pull/935" rel="nofollow">of</a> <a href="https://github.com/CoffeaTeam/coffea/pull/790" rel="nofollow">my</a> <a href="https://github.com/CoffeaTeam/coffea/discussions/1100" rel="nofollow">contributions</a>.`,s,a,d=`In addition to general purpose libraries, some of my work also revolves around
