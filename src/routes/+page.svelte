<h1>YMEC's blog</h1>

<div class="content-container">
  <p>
    Hi! Welcome to the blogs written by Yi-Mu (Enoch) Chen, which contains
    various discussions of physics/technology/mathematics related items that I
    personally found interesting when doing my work or for my hobby poking
    around in various spaces. The posts here are usually self contained or
    smaller-scale projects that still feels resonable to fit within a single
    markdown file, though if there are significant large projects that I think
    is worth mentioning, I will likely include a link here. Feel free to check
    out my full repository on
    <a href="https://github.com/yimuchen">GitHub</a>, or checkout more
    information below! You can also navigate back or somewhere else via the
    hamburger menu (â˜°) pined on the top left of the page.
