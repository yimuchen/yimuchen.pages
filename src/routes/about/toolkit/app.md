Most of my work revolves around developing routines that will be used either by
myself or a small group of people on the same physics analysis team. While I
make an effort to ensure the routine are readable/maintainable to people other
than myself, this type of work typically is not indicative to how well I
actually achieved readability/maintainability goals. Though recently, I've
started to contribute to some of the newer numerical libraries that I have been
using, trying to add tools for general use: here are [some][contrib1]
[of][contrib2] [my][contrib3] [contributions][contrib4].

In addition to general purpose libraries, some of my work also revolves around
writing code for certain control interfaces with the anticipation that the user
has little-to-no code interface knowledge. The most recent iteration of a
custom [command-line shell][cmd_example] (written using Python's [cmd][pycmd]),
as well as a graphical interface using [ReactJS][react] (example code
[here][cmd_example]) and [`PyQt`][qt] (example code [here][qt_example]).
