I've started using Linux based systems for my daily machine since 2011, though
most of my understandings for navigating and managing Unix systems is based on
single-user use-cases. My primary system had been [Arch Linux][archlinux]
(though I'm slowly transitioning to [NixOS][nixos]), so I have quite a bit of
experience with fiddling with various system level settings. My choice for
common tools can be found [here][dotfile].

I have worked with quite a bit of command line tools with command line pipings,
though for complicated tasks, I typically convert to python scripts to have a
more structured program. A core command line tool that I am horrible at is
[git][git]: though I have some experience with multi-user collaboration, it
often defaults to [this solution][xkcd] when edge cases arise.
