I use [LaTeX][latex] frequently, as it is the current standard for the
publication of scientific studies; as well as for reoccurring presentation that
demands consistency rather than the most interesting presentation flows. I know
enough about the typesetting systems to assist with the definition of custom
symbols, defining and tweaking the final layout of the document, and commonly
use the [tikz][tikz] package for drawing simple 2D diagrams. Given the vastness
of available options, however, adjustments to layout is typically a case of
[copy-and-pasting from stack overflow][copynpaste].

Another common form of presentation is the use of the web interface. While I
know the roles of HTML/CSS/JavaScript, given the vastness of CSS options, and
the ever-evolving methods of the JavaScript frameworks. Most of the works in
this area (including this very website you are currently reading) is highly
derivative of resource found on the internet.
