A few weeks back, I began to take a look at
[reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) for presentation making. While the
results looked fantastic, there are one key aspect that I need to mode in: The
ability to keep multiple slides with the same theme with as little overhead as
possible.

## What I needed and tools available

I need to make slides for update reports nearly every week, so I wanted a way
where **all** the styling and plugin management could be placed in a master
`html` file while the contents are kept in other `.md` or `.html` files.

The ability to do so is actually already implemented in the [`markdown`
plugin](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/plugin/markdown/example.html)
of reveal.js, since we could change the entire contents of a slide by the
changing the attributes of the `<section>` tag:

```html
<section data-markdown="example.md"
         data-separator="^\n\n\n"
         data-separator-vertical="^\n\n">
</section>
```

Here we only need to alter one line of code to change a big chunk of content in
my slides!

Now that challenge was solved a bit too easily, so I introduced a new goal: not
having to change the code to alter presentation content, which is more
convenient for people to are interested in the contents of the slide.

I didn't want to go all ham with a [php](http://php.net/) server, as I might
not have the luxury to deploy it. I decided to look into a
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) solution
to the problem.

## Building the solution

There is already a JavaScript function that to change the attribute of a element:

```js
document.getElementById("foo").setAttribute("data-markdown", "my.md" );
```

The only problem is that this function has to be called before the Markdown
plugin is called for the file to actually be processed. So this method could
not be called on an event, but has to be called explicitly during the document
loading. In other words, we have to know what the file we want to load before
the file is loaded. The simplest solution to this is to directly store this
information in the request URL!

We could specify the change we want by a pseudo [HTTP GET
method](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp): altering the URL to
be something like:

```plaintext  nocopy
https://my/url/index.html?date=2016-04-22
```

and extracting the results via JavaScript regex searching:

```js
var page_idx  = window.location.href.search(/date=[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}/);
var page_file = window.location.href.substring(page_date_idx+5,page_date_idx+15);
```

This is of course assuming that the pseudo get method is in a fixed format.
Then we could just past this string onto to the `setAttribute()` method. So if
we include a small error prevention cycle, our `html` body would look something
like:


```html
<div class="reveal">
   <div class="slides">
      <section id="__slide_main__"
         data-markdown="default.md"
         data-separator="^===$"
         data-separator-vertical="^---$">   <!-- Put your own seperators here -->
      </section>
   </div>
</div>
<script type="text/javascript">
   var page_date_idx = window.location.href.search(/date=[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}/);
   if( page_date_idx > 0 ){
      var page_date_str  = window.location.href.substring(page_date_idx+5,page_date_idx+15);
      document.getElementById("__slide_main__").setAttribute("data-markdown", url_base + page_date_str+".md" );
   } else {
      document.getElementById("__slide_main__").setAttribute("data-markdown", url_base + "default.md" );
   }
</script>
```

Note that the name of the `id` is not arbitrary! The Markdown plugin of
reveal.js added its own `id` tags to the generated elements, so if you don't have
special characters in the `id` here, your navigation sequence might get messed
up.


## Tidying up

Now, of course, we could start building the interface to make user experience
event better, like a side-navigation bar to list all the available slides:

```html
<div class="side_bar">
   <h3>Available slides</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><a href="/base/url/index.html?date=2014-04-01">Slides for 2014-04-01</a></li>
      <li><a href="/base/url/index.html?date=2016-04-22">Slides for 2014-04-22</a></li>
      ...
      <li><a href="/base/url/index.html?date=2016-04-22">Slides for 2014-04-22</a></li>   
   </ul>
</div>
```

and add CSS animations to pretty everything up. As to the automatic generation
of this list, there is the problem that JavaScript is client-sides, and isn't
always allowed to access the file system on the server
side[1](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20822273/best-way-to-get-folder-and-file-list-in-javascript),
and I'm still checking with our group server to see what solution I might be
able to use.

Since the slide I used for testing this framework contains some work sensitive
content, I still haven't working version to GitHub.

All in all, this is the first mini-project I have been done in JavaScript. I
must say that anything that is graphics related in coding looks very
gratifying, even is the results are still rather patchy :)
