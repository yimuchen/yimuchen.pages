I have recently tried to practice designing more general purpose classes for my
analysis. Conceptualizing the concept object itself is difficult enough: one
needs to avoid both being specific and too general, but over these days of
experience with C++'s more obscure syntax and quirks, I really began to see why
some might not consider C++ a complete object-oriented programming language.

## The Diamond Problem

One handy way of avoiding repeated code is by class inheritance, so when you
want to merge the functionality of two classes `B` and `C`, one might build an
inherited class `D` that inherits both `B` and `C`:

```cpp title="Simple multiple inheritance"
class B {};
class C {};
class D : public B, public C{};
```

But now a problem arises if `B` and `C` has a common ancestor, say class `A`:

```cpp title="Diamon multiple inheritance"
class A { public: int x;};

class B : public A{};
class C : public A{};
class D : public B, public C{};
```

Because when we create an instance of object `D`, we create an instance of
object `B` and `C`, which respectively creates and instance of object `A`. So
when we write: `C.x`, are we referring to the instance `C::A::D.x` or
`C::B::D.x`? Such is known as the [diamond
problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem),
or the [deadly diamond of
death](http://objectmentor.com/resources/articles/javacpp.pdf)

Each program has their own approach to solving this problem. In C++, we require
that at least one of the intermediate classes to be "virtually inherited", so
that extended classes `D` will only create one instance on grandparent class
`A`:

```cpp title="Virtual inheritance"
class A { public: int x;};

class B : virtual public A{};
class C : virtual public A{};
class D : public B, public C{};
```

In the cases that simple inheritance and virtual inheritance at mixed and
matched, the non-virtually inherited instances create independent instances of
base class `A`, and explicit paths are used expressed access:

```cpp title="Example of multiple inheritance"
class A { public: int x;};

class B : virtual public A{ public: int b; };
class C : virtual public A{ public: int c; };
class E : public A{ public: int e ; };
class D : public B, public C, public E{};

D d;

d.x = d.b = d.c = d.e; // All Legal variables
d::B.x; // Equivalent to d.x
d::A.x; // Equivalent to d.x
d::E.x; // An Independent variable to the one above!
```

While this does give most of the flexibility to the user as to what variables
are used in an extended inheritance class, this still poses some issues: Since
a virtual instance of grandparent class exists, the grandchild class has to
explicitly call grandparent constructor for initialization (unless an
argument-less constructor exists). While it seems like a minor feature, it
still means that abstraction in not as "opaque" as it should be. For instance,
Python tackles this problem by guessing the meaning of `d.x` by the inheritance
order during the declaration `class D(B,C,E):`, with the rule of thumb being
"First found in DSF searching" and allowing syntax for hierarchy shifting,
which makes class design much more intuitive.

## The missing `vtable` error message

One of the most infuriating compile error messages in `g++4.9.3` is:

```plaintext nocopy
In function <class>::<constructor>
undefined reference to vtable for <class>
```

As it is annoying uninformative as to what is missing. A simplified view of the
`vtable` (or virtual table) is a table of virtual methods that the compiler
generates for a class, which is then linked for each class in an inheritance
hierarchy. Missing `vtable` may be caused by the following issues:

- The file containing the `vtable` was not included for linking.
- The `vtable` was not generated. For a `vtable` to be generated, the all
  instances of reimplemented virtual functions to exists.

Most of the time, when a method is missing, the following error message is much
more informative:

```plaintext nocopy
Error: undefined reference to <class>::<method>(<arguments>)
```

But in the case of methods related to the `vtable` generation, the error
messages for missing methods is all compacted into a `missing vtable` and send
to look for bugs in the constructor. Not only are you not-told where you bug
might be, but it actively tells you to look for somewhere where the bug isn't.

I know that the error messages have been greatly improved in `g++6.1`. But
working in a collaboration, I don't have the luxury to choose which compiler
version I get to use. This is a memo to help me remember what this error
message means and how to avoid it in the future.
