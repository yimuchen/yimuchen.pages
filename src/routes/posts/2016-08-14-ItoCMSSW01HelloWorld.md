Let's begin with the simplest of examples for any programming language, how to
write a hello world program. The example files used in this page could be found
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw8_U9a0g9nHTHhjSlNiamQ5RWc/view?usp=sharing),
and extract the file to the `CMSSW_X_X_X/src` directory with the command:

```bash
tar -zxvf HelloWorld.tar.gz
```

Remember each time you enter this directory, you should load the CMSSW
environment with the command

```bash
cmsenv
```

If you wish to follow the build the sample up yourself, I will also be listing
the directory structure used below

## Writing a main function and a first look at `BuildFiles`

### Writing a working version

Writing a main function is simple, but you will need to structure your file in
the specific structure to properly expose the file containing the main function
to the `CMSSW` compiling environment. For the simplest example of just one file
containing a main function, you will need to construct the following structure
below the `CMSSW_X_X_X/src` directory:

```plaintext nocopy
CMSSW_X_X_X/src
└── <HelloWorld>
    └── <Example1>
        └── bin
            ├── BuildFile.xml
            └── <main>.cc

```

where all the files and directory could be named whatever you want with a few
exceptions:

- Your `<main>.cc` file must end with a valid C++ extension: `.cc`, `.cpp`,
  `.cxx` and such.
- The `BuildFile.xml` must be named exactly as indicated.

Write your `main.cc` however you like, and add in the `BuildFile.xml` the file
below.

```xml
<bin name="HelloWorld" file="main.cc"/>
```

Be careful to change the entry after `file` to be whatever you have called your
C++ file. Now you can call the `CMSSW` compile command in any working directory
above `HelloWorld/Example1`.

```bash
scram b
```

After the command has finished (and no compile errors are produced), you should
now have a new command available, type `HelloWorld` (or whatever you have
added in the `name` entry in the `BuildFile.xml`) into your command line and
see the result of your main file!

```plaintext nocopy
[user@machine Example1] HelloWorld
Hello World!
```

### Simple explanation of The `BuildeFile.xml`

The `BuildFile.xml` replaces the `makefile` file to tell the compiler what to
compile; in our case, the contents for our file `BuidlFile.xml` is rather
simple, you could read as:

- Request to build a `bin`ary file to be called `HelloWorld` using the main
  function found in the C++ file `main.cc`.

The binary file that is created would be stored under the `CMSSW_X_X_X/bin/`.
The first thing that you could try out is that you could write multiple main
function files in the `Example1/bin` directory provided that the final
executable are named differently! Just remember for each new `.cc` you write to
add an entry in the `BuildFile.xml`.

It is also worth noting that `xml` is fully named the [_extensible markup
language_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML), which is used for storing
information in a document in a specific way so that should be both human- and
machine-readable. Though commonly seen in web application (alongside his famous
cousin [`HTML`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)), the usage of `xml` files
are not limit to such applications only.

Writing a main function is only the first step. If you are the kind of guy that
writes analysis code in a single file consisting of a few thousand lines of
code, then I can guarantee you that after three weeks without looking at it,
the code would become unintelligible, even by the writer. How you write you own
libraries and split subroutines into multiple files is on big step for making
you code readable. This ties in with the next part we will be looking at, about
directories other than `bin` and how to write their corresponding
`BuildFile.xml`

## The CMSSW `BuildFile` structure

Here we take a look at a more complicated structure. One what that might
commonly occur:

- We want to create a library `ExampleLib` containing the complete
  implementation of a class and relate function.
- We want some additional wrapper function to help interface the classes to the
  main function
- The main function to actually execute the code.

The structure we would want to create would be something like this:

```
CMSSW_X_X_X/src
└── HelloWorld
    ├── Example2
    │   ├── bin
    │   │   ├── BuildFile.xml
    │   │   └── main.cc
    │   ├── interface
    │   │   └── funclib.hpp
    │   └── src
    │       ├── BuildFile.xml
    │       └── funclib.cc
    └── ExampleLib
        ├── interface
        │   └── MyClass.hpp
        └── src
            ├── BuildFile.xml
            ├── MyClass.cc
            └── MyClass_Say.cc
```

### Exposing a library and understanding the include path

Inside the directory `HelloWorld/ExampleLib` is a class declaration and
implementation

```cpp showLineNumer title="Some example code of sharinf functions"
// in MyClass.hpp
#ifndef HELLOWORLD_MYCLASS
#define HELLOWORLD_MYCLASS
#include <string>
class MyClass {
public:
   MyClass( const std::string& );
   virtual ~MyClass ();
   void Say( const std::string& );
private:
   const std::string _name;
};
#endif

//-------------------------
// in MyClass.cc
#include "HelloWorld/ExampleLib/interface/MyClass.hpp"
MyClass::MyClass( const std::string& x ) : _name(x) {}
MyClass::~MyClass(){}

//-------------------------
// in MyClass_Say.cc
#include "HelloWorld/ExampleLib/interface/MyClass.hpp"
#include <iostream>
void MyClass::Say( const std::string& x ){
   std::cout << this->_name << " says: " << x << std::endl ;
}
```

Looking at how the various `.cc` file include the common header, you can see
that the CMSSW compile environment adds a new include path in the compilation
flags, which is the `CMSSW_X_Y_Z/src` directory! To tell the compiler that the
contents of this folder is meant for a shared library, you must include this
line in the `BuildFile.xml` file:

```xml
<export><lib name="1" /></export>
```

Again the meaning of this file is meant to be human-readable:

> Export **every** c++ file in the `HelloWorld/ExampleLib/src` directory as a
> single shared object file, with the library name left automatic (1).

You can see this in action by checking the content in `CMSSWW_X_Y_Z/lib`
directory.

All this instruction is well, but a shared library isn't much use without an
executable file.

### Using shared libraries.

We first use an example of a library using another library. In the directory
`HelloWorld/Example2`, we could see in the `interface/funclib.hpp` and
`src/funclib.cc` file that this library provides one function, which depends on
the example just given:

```cpp
#include "HelloWorld/ExampleLib/interface/MyClass.hpp"
#include <iostream>
int myfunction()
{
   static MyClass myinst("hello"); myinst.Say("World");
   std::cout <<  "Hello World from my function!" << std::endl;
   return 0;
}
```

Again, note how the external header file is included. Now for the building of
this library we need to link it with the functions found in
`HelloWorld/ExampleLib`, so the `BuildFile.xml` in `HelloWorld/Example2/src`
need to have one more line:

```xml
<use name="HelloWorld/ExampleLib" /> <export><lib name="1" /></export>
```

The second line is already exampled with the `HelloWorld/ExampleLib` build
file. The first line list the dependency of this library. Notice to list a
library withing CMSSW as a dependency, you just need to use the `use` tag, with
the `name` field being the directory of the dependency from within the
`CMSSW_X_Y_Z/src` directory!

Finally, for the `BuildFile.xml` in the `bin` directory, where the main function
file requires the use of both of these external libraries, the `BuildFile.xml`
there would read something like:

```html
<use name="HelloWorld/ExampleLib" />
<use name="HelloWorld/Example2" />
<bin name="HelloWorld2" file="main.cc" />
```

Go and give the code a run and add your own tweaks, this should give you an
idea of how to write your own libraries in the `CMSSW` compiling environment.

## More details about the `BuildFile.xml`.

As we have previously states, the `BuildFile.xml` is designed to reduce the
verbosity of writing `MakeFile` like compiling control flows. This
simplification is based on the fact that code structure of the `CMSSW`
compiling environment is very strict. With all the `BuildFile.xml` required to
be located under a `CMSSW_X_X_X/src/Package/Subpackage/<dir>` path, where
`<dir>` could only be named as a directory that the compile environment
recognizes. What `<dir>` could be will be picked up as we go along.

### Official packages that you can add to `use`

When you first initiate your `CMSSW` environment, the `src` directory might
look empty. The whole arsenal of packages and sub-packages in the official
`CMSSW` repository would be pre-compiled and at your disposal. Which is a good
thing, because the whole CMSSW code would take approximately 20 hours to
compile at the very least. For example, your package could have C++ code that
reads:

```cpp
// In a c++ file
#include "DataFormats/FWLite/interace/Event.hpp"
```

together with the `BuildFile.xml` with contents

```html
<!--- In a BuildFile.xml  --->
<use name="DataFormats/FWLite" />
```

would be totally legal. For a list of all the packages you could use, see the
[official GitHub page](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw). Some of these official
`CMSSW` packages are highly specialized packages for specific use cases within
the operator of CMS operation, data collecting and processing, while other
packages are core framework packages that will be used by nearly everyone who
needs information from the data collected at CMS. The core packages will be
what we mainly focus on for these tutorials.

### External libraries to be added to use.

What about packages outside `CMSSW`? Unfortunately, there is no easy way of
including them. But there are special libraries that are commonly used in the
field of experimental high energy physics that could be used without hassle.
These libraries include: 

- [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/): `<use name="root"/>`
- [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/) plotting libraries and [RooFit](https://root.cern.ch/roofit): `<use name="roofit"/>`
- The entire [boost](http://www.boost.org/) library: `<use name="boost"/>`
- The [boost program options](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/doc/html/program_options.html) libraries: `<use name="boost_program_options"/>`
- The [boost python](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/libs/python/doc/html/index.html) libraries: `<use name="boost_python"/>`

### Defining additional compile flags

If you wish to define additional compilation flags for specific optimization,
debugging, declaring MACROS, and others, then you could do so for individual
`BuildFile.xml` with lines such as

```html
<flag CXXFLAGS="-O1 -g" /> <flag CPPDEFINE="DEBUG=1" />
```

## Additional documentations and closing words

This is by no means an exhaustive list of all the structures and options
allowed in `CMSSW`, for the official documentation, see
[here](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideBuildFile). We
will be picking the ones we need up as we go along, but hopefully, with this
knowledge it will become easier for you to organize the code in your analysis
into a more organized structure.
