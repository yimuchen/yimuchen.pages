Have you ever complained that writing complicated equations in latex is
painful, especially when you are writing how an equation is solved. You might
think you are writing the same things over and over again, give in to the [copy
and paste mentality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself), then
find that the source you originally copied and had a small typo and your
compilation of the document is an explosion of error messages. While writing
custom commands will not make all the pain go away, it does help with reducing
the amount of typing, as well as help keep a consistent look in you final
output.

## An example - Partial differential

To get and idea of the power of custom commands, lets start of with an example
that might be commonly encountered by physics students. If you have ever tried
to write partial differential equations in latex, you would know it is
incredibly verbose to type out, with the typical fraction form of a first order
partial derivative looking something like:

```latex title="The vanilla experience" nocopy
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
= \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}
```

to produce

$$
\pd{f}{x} + \pd{f}{y} = \pd{f}{z}
$$

which might feel very annoying to type, with far-apart braces, repeating
symbols, when the only really input relevant to the final output being `f` and
`x`, `y`, `z`.

Let's look at what we could do with a custom command. In your latex file before
the equation you could write:

```tex title="A simple new command"
\newcommand{\pd}[2]{\frac{\partial #1}{\partial #2}}
```

and in you actual equation, we would only need to type:

```tex title="Latex with macros"
\pd{f}{x} + \pd{f}{y} = \pd{f}{z}
```

To produce the same output! One obvious merit of this that the equation in the
LaTeX file is a lot easier to read and write. Another merit is that suppose one
day, you realized that you don't want the fraction form of the partial
derivatives but the inline form:

$$
\partial_{x} f + \partial_{y} f = \partial_{z} f
$$

All you will need to do is change the command you have defined to be something
like:

```tex title="Updated command!"
\newcommand{\pd}[2]{\frac{\partial_{#2} #1}}
```

and then every instance in you LaTeX file where you have used the command
`\pd{a}{b}` will be changed to the new inline format!

## Command in details

A complete documentation of how commands are written could be found on the
[Macro](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Macros#New_commands) wiki book
page. But the example given above is a rather self-explanatory example of how
to define you own command.

```tex title="\newcommand breakdown" nocopy
\newcommand{\<commandname>}[<number of argument>]{what to do with the argument}
```

In the final set of curly braces, the input of the first argument should we
write as `#1` and so on.

If you are familiar with the use of [macros in
C/C++](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Macros.html), you might already have
an idea of how the commands work: they expand the defined expression of `\pd`
at every instance that looks like `\pd{f}{x}` in a file into the full
`\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}` before the TeX engine begins its typesetting
routine. Also, similar to the macros in C/C++, macros in latex and call one
another, provided that they have already been defined. For example, suppose we
what to define how anti-particle and particle-antiparticle pairs are
represented in our file using macros, we could write the macros as something
like:

```tex
\newcommand{\anti}[1]{\ensuremath{\bar{#1}}}
\newcommand{\pair}[1]{\ensuremath{#1\anti{#1}}}
```

The `ensuremath` makes sure to load the math typesetting environment for the
code withing the curly braces. So the snippet `\pair{c}` will produce
$c\bar{c}$, regardless of where we place the `\pair{c}` code is placed in the
latex dollar braces or not.

Notice that a command can have no arguments, in which case your command is
simply a shorthand for a collection of symbols. An example could be if you are
constantly dealing with particle and anti-particle pairs, it might be handy to
have a shorthand like:

```tex
\newcommand{\ttbar}{\pair{t}}
```

to make the `tex` file look more natural.

Considering that in the final output of

$$
\text{Consider the production of $\text{t}^{*}\bar{\text{t}}{}^{*}$ in $\text{p}\bar{\text{p}}$ collisions}\\
$$

$$
\text{with a center-of-mass energy of 100$\TeV$ at an integrated luminosity of 100fb$^{-1}$}
$$

With macros, the raw latex code could look something like

> Consider the production of `\tstarpair` in `\ppbar` collisions with a
> center-of-mass energy of 100TeV at an integrated luminosity of 100`\fbinv`

Rather than the raw latex code that looks like:

> Consider the production of `$\text{t}^{*}\bar{\text{t}}{}^{*}$` in a
> `$\text{p}\bar{\text{p}}$` collision with a center-of-mass energy of 100TeV
> at an integrated luminosity of 100`fb$^{-1}$`

## Simple commands sharing between files

At one point, you might want to write with the same symbols over multiple
documents. For examples you are writing work relate to a course of applied
mathematics would constantly use the partial differential symbol. You could, of
course, copy and paste the same commands every time you begin a new file, but
then you are no longer guaranteed that your all your documents share the same
command once you begin to alter the files. For projects where all documents are
within the same folder, say your folder looks like:

```plaintext nocopy
YourFolder
├── Assignment1.tex
├── Assignment2.tex
└── Assignment3.tex
```

Where each `Assignment*.tex` file generates a different `pdf` file. The easiest
way to share command in this case, would be to write a file `mycommand.tex`
containing all the command you wish to share, and then write the in the
individual `Assignment.tex` files, write something like the following:

```tex
\input{mycommand.tex}

Now I can use the \pd{x}{y} command wherever I want!
```

A complete documentation of what the `\input` command works can be found on the
wikibook page dedicated to [modular file
structures](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Modular_Documents). If you are
familiar with the `#include` preprocess of C/C++, you might also know how this
command works: It is (nearly) a naive dump of the contents of the file
`mycommand.tex` to the position the `\input` command is called before
evoking the TeX typesetting engine.

## Command sharing for files anywhere

Suppose that one has designed a [beautiful set of equation
short-hands](https://github.com/enochnotsocool/UnixConfig/blob/master/TexSettings/mathHashing.sty)
that you want to use for any new project you may be writing. One method is of
course putting the `mycommand.tex` file in a fixed location in your computer
and always `\input` that file. But let's face it, beginning a file with

```
\input{/home/user/settings/texsetting/mathcommands.tex}
```

or even worse:

```
\input{../../../../settings/texsetting/mathcommands.tex}
```

doesn't feel elegant. Can you get the LaTeX command to find the file for you?
The answer is yes! Rename the file `mathcommands.sty`, and put it in the
directory:

```
/home/<username>/texmf/tex/latex/mathcommands.sty # Unix
C:User\<username>\tex\latex\mathhcommands.sty     # Windows
```

And in your latex file, instead of the `\input` command. Use the `\usepackage`
command before the beginning of the document body:

```tex
\usepackage{mathcommand} % No filename extentions!
\begin{document}
I can use \pd{x}{y} anywhere in the document!
\end{document}
```

Latex packages are of course more than a collection of custom commands, you can
read about it more on the dedicated wikibook page on
[packages](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Creating_Packages). Of course if
you consider a user-wide `.sty` file overkill, the `.sty` file be used in a
single project folder too.

## Caveats of storing file in commands

One major problem about using file to store custom commands is that to share
the latex code with someone, you can no longer just share the snippet you are
using, but you have to share all the file that contains custom commands as
well. Depending on the scale of you collaboration, this may or may not be a
problem. With the raise of cloud editing platforms such as
[sharelatex](https://www.sharelatex.com/), this pain could be reduced without
needing to go all out and host a git repository for you TeX projects.
