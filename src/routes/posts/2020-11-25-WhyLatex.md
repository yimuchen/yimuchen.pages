title: Why learn Latex?
description: Thoughts of the constructive and detrimental aspects of teaching Latex as the standard typesetting tool for STEM students.

If you are pursuing a degree in STEM, you'll probably run into this
dreaded/beloved rule tool at one point: [LaTeX][LaTeX]. Opinions on using LaTeX
as the tool for type-settings assignments seem to be extremely polarized
between students: those who like it usually take their passion to the extreme,
declaring anyone who uses anything other typesetter as either tasteless or
mindless slaves of the evil Microsoft Office suite; while people who hate it
also hate it with a passion, often refusing to use it unless absolutely
required for an assignment, and often vowing never to touch it again.

I thought to revisit this question after this question pop up in one of my
social media thread: outside STEM academia, what good is learning LaTeX? And I
was surprised to see that most respondent jumped in immediately to say a firm:
no, LaTeX is in fact useless outside of STEM academia, even people that have
been avid users of LaTeX. I personally think this view, though “correct” in the
sense there are little if no direct applications of LaTeX outside of STEM
academia, cannot be further from the truth: learning LaTeX properly can give
you a set of skill greatly beneficial to you outside academia. I feel the issue
is deeply tied with my main cases against LaTeX, how the use of LaTeX in most
STEM assignments failed to address what LaTeX is, and what it is used for. So
let us start the discussion with that.

## The case against LaTeX

My case against LaTeX is largely summed up in [this article][latex-fetish] from
4 years ago, and my stance against teaching LaTeX the haphazard method that
usually occurs in STEM assignments has largely stayed the same: LaTeX is not
taught as a typesetting tool, with proper introductions to it benefits and
limitations. Instead, it is taught as a loosely and often uncoordinated list of
seemingly arbitrary rules, which ends up with LaTeX being reduced to a merely a
requirement which acts as a barrier of entry for students who have never used
LaTeX before. For the few lucky individuals that manage to wrap their heads
around basic LaTeX then use this as a bragging right instead of diving deeper
into what LaTeX can achieve and usually end up generating documents that I can
easily typeset better in a typical WYSIWYG processor.

LaTeX, at the end of the day, is a tool developed by computer scientist to use
computer science methods to solve typesetting issues. Failing to introduce it
as such leave so much wasted potential on the table, with much of the reusable
concepts being left out, leading most to declare LaTeX as useless. The
following discussion for some cases of LaTeX are by no means universal, but
highlight how properly learning LaTeX can benefit you in areas outside pure
academic writing.

## The case for LaTeX

So how can LaTeX be beneficial outside of academia, the following is by no
means an exhaustive list, but I think presents interesting arguments for the
beginning of discussions.

### The Golden standard for mathematical symbol typesetting

Probably the most important reason for STEM to be using LaTeX is it being the
golden standard for mathematical symbol typesetting.
[Fractions][latex-fraction], [nested super/subscripts][latex-subscript],
[mixing uniform and non-uniform symbol heights][latex-largesymbol], [custom
character decorations][latex-decorate], [dynamically changing symbol
size][latex-braces] based on other content... Name any sort of weird and exotic
symbol placements for mathematical expressions, LaTeX most likely has a way of
typesetting what you want. LaTeX was so much in the lead so many years ago that
it has become more than a tool in this aspect: it is now a standard that other
tools try to follow. Be it plotting tools in [Python][latex-python], WYSISWG
[equation editors][equation-editor], even the [hotkeys][ms-hotkey] for equation
typesetting in Microsoft Word are based on LaTeX syntax.

$$
\frac{\pi^2}{6} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2}
$$

If you are a STEM student, chances are that you will be using mathematical
symbols and related typesetting functions in you work, whether you choose to
stay in academia or not. If you are a bit of a document neat-freak like I am,
and if seeing even simply mathematic text like $\text{log}10(x)$ in plots or
descriptions instead of the formal $\log_{10}(x)$ makes your skin crawl, then
learning latex is definitely worth it, even if just for learning how to typeset
mathematical expression. It might feel like a brute force method to learn
something as mundane as hotkeys and character sheets, but LaTeX puts this
method of type setting first and foremost under your eyes, forcing you to learn
and get familiar with this typesetting standard.

### Document structure enforced by default

Formal documents often have predefined structures: sections and subsections,
chapters and such. Titles of such structures are typically highlighted using
enlarged fonts with perhaps a different font. How you create such structures in
a WYSIWYG editor? Given the toolbar show at the top of the window, it most
straight forward way making such structure is to simply type in the editing
window:

```plaintext title="In you editor window..." nocopy
1 My first structure title

1.1 My first sub-structure title
```

Then move to the many pronounced buttons in to toolbar and start pushing
buttons until you get it to look right. While this is all fine and good for the
first few lines, the problem then starts when the document starts getting
large. What if the style of the sub-subsection title? Let me scroll to the
previous instance of a sub-subsection title. Wait... is this one such title
that I forgot to format, or is this just a one-line paragraph starting with a
decimal number? What number am I on again to add a new section? Oh no, the font
settings for section titles is too large, let me scroll through the document
and fix all the formats. Then when the document is printed, every notices that
one instance where you missed the formatting, and now you feel angry at having
just wasted a bunch of paper. All hell breaks loose when you use manual labor
to construct structure tracking content such as list-of-figures.

This is the issue of not using document structuring tools provided by the
office suites ([Word][word-doc] and [LibreOffice][libreoffice-doc] usage
documentations here). While the office suites have been trying hard to push
such functionalities forwards to the user, people typically stick with what
they are familiar with, leading to people generating truly horrific documents
that are excessively difficult to maintain and edit. Meanwhile, in LaTeX land,
maybe one of *the first* command one learns is the construction of document
structures.

```latex title="Default way of handling structure"
\section{My first structure title}
\subsection{My first sub-structure title}
```

The equivalent of all the button pushing in a WYSISYG editor is effectively
writing a LaTeX document as something like:

```latex title="Hacking way of handling structure styling"
\textbf{\fontsize{18}{24}\selectfont 1. My first structure title}
\textbf{\fontsize{16}{20}\selectfont 1.1 My first sub-structure title}
```

It is explicitly more exhausting to structure a document wrongly than it is to
write it in the “correct” way in LaTeX! This is one of the key aspects of LaTeX
that can be a takeaway for anyone doing document management, even if you are
not a computer science enthusiast: Computer are so much better at keeping track
of mundane details than the human brain is, find the way for the computer to
assist you with the mundane, and leave your brain free for the more important
type settings and writing task! WYSISWG editors leaves this as an option to be
explored, LaTeX presents this as the default option.

This of course, isn't an entirely foolproof solution to document structures.
I've still seen LaTeX documentations that resort to the horrific typesetting
method in the second code snippet above when some people are trying to do fancy
title formatting instead of [RTFM][RTFM]. The true solution would be to use
LaTeX as a starting point for learning more fundamental concepts in document
management such as [markup languages][markup] and style-context separation,
which incidentally is also an important building block for Web applications
that are ubiquitous today.

### Appreciation for good typesetting and micro typesetting

This I feel is the biggest plus of learning LaTeX in my personal experience. A
lot of people claim that LaTeX generates good type-setting, but they spend little
time in investing what makes the default typesetting generated by LaTeX good.
This is probably the best example of how powerful a tool LaTeX is, with one key
philosophy behind the TeX typesetting engine being that there are some
typesetting just too complicated to do by hand, so let's have a machine do it for
us. Here are a couple of examples to the typesetting and micro-typesetting used
by the LaTeX that is greatly used in the field of formal publications. The
following is by no means an exhaustive list, but is meant to get people to
appreciate what LaTeX does well and get people to appreciate good typesetting in
general medium.

For the comparison for default typesetting used in LaTeX and a WYSIWYG editor,
I'm going to paste the first two paragraphs of this article into the two
typesetters. For the sake of image generation, I'm using a A5 paper with a 0.8”
margin all around the page (this is hopefully the last time I use imperial units
in my writing), with a font size of 10pt. All other settings will be left at
default unless otherwise specified. The font will be left default for both
typesetters, so [Computer Modern][computermodern] for LaTeX and [Times New
Roman][times] for the Office Suites (Aha! Here we are already seeing a problem
with LaTeX! How many users know how to apply these settings to a LaTeX document
without resorting to Google? I certainly didn't! With LibreOffice/Word, I'm
pretty confidence anyone who is mildly tech-savvy can find these setting by
looking through the dropdown menus) Now let us see the result:

<figure class="half">
  <img src="../../image/posts/20201125/latex_test.png"       alt="" style="background-color:white;"/>
  <img src="../../image/posts/20201125/word_test_unjust.png" alt="" style="background-color:white;"/>
  <figcaption>
  Display of the documents generated as described, the document from the left
  uses LaTeX, the document on the right uses LibreOffice
  </figcaption>
</figure>

I think most would agree that the document on the left looks, better. But why?
Let us get into the specifics.

#### Proper justified text boxes

One feature that most people will notice is that the right side of the document
is flushed at some bounding box in the LaTeX version. A visual well-defined
boundary enhances the reading experience by having the brain immediately
understanding where to start and stop before actually beginning to read. This is
formally called [“justified” alignment][justified]. But some may complain that
this option is available in Office suites too, and it is unfair that bash on
office suites when justified alignment is literally 1 button press away. So lets
compare the two documents again with the justified settings on in the Office
suite document:

<figure class="half">
  <img src="../../image/posts/20201125/latex_test.png"     alt="" style="background-color:white;"/>
  <img src="../../image/posts/20201125/word_test_just.png" alt="" style="background-color:white;"/>
  <figcaption>
  Display of the documents generated as described, the document from the left
   uses LaTeX, the document on the right uses LibreOffice with justified text alignment
   </figcaption>
</figure>

Now the comparison feels closer, but the feel of the right document still feels
inhomogeneous. Two obvious examples of this inhomogeneous feeling can be found on
the forth row of the first paragraph and the second row of the second paragraph
on the right. Both lines stand out as feeling oddly blank, with some word feeling
oddly stretched out.

The reason for this is that true-justified alignment is incredibly difficult to
do! The spacing between words and characters must be taken into account when
calculating what needs to be done for just a single line of justified alignment,
can this calculation will in turn determine at which word should new lines begin.
For WYSIWYG editors, where characters can literally disappear at the push of a
button, running the full calculation is unacceptable for most users (you probably
don't want to wait 30 seconds for the page to render when you accidentally hit a
backspace at the beginning of a 30-page document!) so such tools typically resort
to “lazy” justified alignment methods simply blow up the spacing in a simple
flush-left aligned document and hope for the best.

Indications for this technique being employed is most obviously seen by the fact
that no words change lines when toggling between flush-left and justified
alignment. But if you do the toggle between a flush-left and justified alignment
in LaTeX, the context shift is very pronounced. LaTeX has the benefit that the
where words can characters can go is calculated after all the context is provided
by the user, therefore having all the time in the world to chew the numbers
required for a pretty justified layout (As a side note, the blog you are staring
at right now also uses lazy justified alignment defined in the [CSS
standard][css-justified] and implemented by various browsers. That is why some
lines may look“weird”, and why most website still don't use justified alignment.)

The problem becomes even more complicated when we take into account
hyphen-separated line breaks (which unfortunately doesn't show up in our
example): where can the hyphens be? Everyone can agree that breaking the line in
between a word like “you” using a hyphenation like y-ou is very ugly and breaks
the flow of reading. But what about more involved words such as “involved”, where
can the hyphen be there? Are the better ways of line breaks without resorting to
hyphens? Is there in fact a better solution when considering later text
combinations? All these questions require a surprising amount of computation
time, which WYSISYG editors simply don't have.

#### Micro typesetting --- Ligatures and Kerning

Micro typesetting mainly refers to the placement relation of characters within a
word that optimizes the flow of reading. A good micro-typesetting contributes to
the feeling of togetherness of elements when reading. Let's look at the most
obvious fault in the LibreOffice document, the word “beneficial”:

<figure class="half">
  <img src="../../image/posts/20201125/beneficial_latex.png"  alt="" />
  <img src="../../image/posts/20201125/beneficial_word.png"   alt=""/>
  <figcaption>
  Display of the word "beneficial" as written by the default font in Latex
  (left, Computer Modern), and LibreOffice (right, Times New Roman).
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The dissonance in the Times New Roman font of the f and i characters being “kind
of together but not quite” generate a feeling that the word is somehow broken.
Computer Modern gets around this by having what is known as
[ligatures][ligature]: simply defining sets of characters into a single glyph to
be used together in print: instead of 2 separate glyphs f and i, the document
contains a single character fi. While computer Modern doesn't contain an entire
set of ligatures used in English (looking at the double t's in the documents, I
would say that Times New Roman does a better job than Computer Modern), why the
default font for Office suites is one with so little ligatures sets is kind of
perplexing. But I here you say: changing fonts is just a push of a couple of
buttons! This “flaw” cannot be held against my Office tools. And I would say no
they should not be held accountable... if you know how to enable them! Ligatures
are off **by default** in the popular office suite: Microsoft Office. For the
sake of argument, let us render the documents again with a ligature complete
font: [Linux Libertine][libertine]. Here, I'm going to cheat a bit by taking a
screenshot of the Office editing window instead of exporting it to PDF to
highlight certain issues with WYSIWYG editor not doing a good job at rendering
“good” typesetting to the user.

<figure class="half">
  <img src="../../image/posts/20201125/latex_libertine.png"  style="background-color:white;" alt="" />
  <img src="../../image/posts/20201125/word_libertine.png"   alt=""/>
  <figcaption>
  Display of the documents rendered by LaTeX (left) and the LibreOffice
  editing window(right), both using Linux Libertine as the font.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Here we can see the editing window of the LibreOffice is riddled with strange
words designs, despite using the same font: words like “vowing” in the last line
of the first paragraph looks disjointed between the i and n; words like “people”
have two distinct designs between the first and second paragraph. These are
examples of poor kerning, or inter-glyphs spacing within a word. Again, good
kerning gives the characters of a work a sense of togetherness that enhances
reading, while bad kerning makes certain words look like typos. While kerning
issues displayed is fixed when LibreOffice exports the document to a PDF or a
printer, I feel that having the user have an immediate feel of what is good
typesetting during editing is equally important for a pleasant writing
experience.

#### Proper substitution of fonts

I think most people that use bold fonts under windows will subconsciously think
bold fonts look... strange. This is best highlighted with denser Chinese
characters, where character strokes are packed closer together. Let us look at
this two words using the same font family in Microsoft Office. The left most
characters using a regular [Noto Sans Font][noto], the center characters uses the
“bold” method used by clicking a big **B** button in Microsoft Office, and the
right characters uses the correct method of generating bold fonts: using Noto
Sans Bold.

<figure>
  <img src="../../image/posts/20201125/fake_bold.png"  alt="" />
  <figcaption>
  Display of 2 Chinese characters in regular (left) fake bold (center)
  and real bold (right) in Microsoft Word using Noto Sans CJK TC as the
  example font.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

We can see that the default bold method generated by Microsoft Office is a
horrific mess, basically it takes the existing font and just extrapolates each
stroke, resulting in strokes being mushed together as well as horrible
anti-aliasing artifacts appearing towards the ends of the strokes. The correct
method of generating bold font is to use a designed font set with the spacing
management specifically designed to handle broader strokes. For LaTeX the type
setting engine automatically substitutes the correct font when you specify that
you want a bold font, only resorting to the horrible fake bold method is no
corresponding bold font can be found on the system. You probably don't know the
existence of the bold variation of the Time New Roman font!

#### General typesetting rules

None the typesetting decisions discussions above are strictly perks of LaTeX then
sub-par choices made by various office suites. Different office suites handle the
various typesetting above differently. For example: Microsoft Word has a much
more sophisticated justified calculation engine (it runs per paragraph rather
than per-line) though the lack of hyphening word breaks still leave a couple of
lines feeling a bit empty; Word also handles a more consistent kerning rule in
the presentation window, though (by default) refuses to use ligatures even when
the features are present in the font, and refuses (by default) to perform font
substitution when switching font weights. LibreOffice on the other hand, has the
horrific kerning rules in the presentation window, with the application of
ligatures a bit too enthusiastic leading to weird intra-word spacing, and opts to
fix these typesetting issues during the export process; what LibreOffice does
correctly is substitute the font for font weights. But the overall argument still
stands: see how much LaTeX gets right *by default*? This is what people mean by
LaTeX documents look “nicer”. When compounded with the fact of consistent
formatting among document structure elements, it is little wonder why LaTeX
remains the defacto standard for academic typesetting.

Of course, what we have discussed mainly focuses on what computers (and in turn
LaTeX) does well: micromanagement of well-defined typesetting rules. In general,
I like to describe the results of the LaTeX typesetting as **beautifully
boring**, it lacks any visual flare that can be used to drawing your eyes to
certain important elements in a page (why LaTeX beamer slide nearly always looks
boring), but what presents structure in a consistent and neat format exceedingly
well, which is exactly what most books for formal presentation are looking for,
hence it's popularity in academic works, particularly in STEM related fields.

That is not the end of the story of typesetting. LaTeX does not guard against bad
**macro**-typesetting practices. Take this textbook that is obviously designed
using LaTeX as an example:

<figure>
  <img src="../../image/posts/20201125/book.jpg"  alt="" />
  <figcaption>
  Example page take from the textbook "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning",
  by Christopher Bishop. Contextually, this is a splendid book! The main culprit
  I want to discuss here is less the author, and more the publisher: Springer.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Why is the larger margin for the right pages, which should be designed to guard
against physical damaged, as well as act as a space for note-taking placed
towards the spine of the book, where damage is least likely to occur and the most
annoying part of the book to write on?? As a small rant, I find this sort of bad
typesetting decision much more prominent in recent textbooks than the older ones.
With a lot of learning material moving to electronic media, such design choices
are understandable: a PDF by default may be seen as a list of single faced paper
rather than a book, but at the same time I find this failure to adapt content for
the presentation media a huge oversight: this is what computer typesetting
engines are good for, adapting layouts without manual contextual edits!

## Why any of this is important

LaTeX is a tool, specifically a typesetting tool ([**not** a writing
tool!][latex-fetish]) with incredible features and beautiful defaults. I feel
that a good tool, beside the obvious gets-things-done requirement, assists the
user in getting things done *the right way*, and make the user appreciate why the
right is considered correct. LaTeX, when taught correctly, can do a bunch of
these things, as well as give great insight as to what makes good typesetting
good, and all of this is already leaving out the more nerdy comp-sci features
such as code-reusability and modularization and such! At the end of the day,
declaring a tool as “useless” just because one missed the point of what LaTeX tries
to provide, what it does well, and appreciation of what goes into making “good”
tool, feel a tad hasty, wouldn't you say?
